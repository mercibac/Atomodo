ATOMODO (Atomic habits & Pomodoro technique) is an utility that helps you to manage daily tasks by splitting them into small sessions of 25 or 50 minutes with maximum focus (no mail, social network notifications, etc. ). That's is the Pomodoro technique side.

Atomic habits technique is used when we have a habit that we want to develop but we always procrastinate. So in order to accomplish it and cultivate a new competence or a new way of life, we took 2 or 5 minutes per day that we allocate to that task. With the implementation of the habit, we can increase that time progressively.
